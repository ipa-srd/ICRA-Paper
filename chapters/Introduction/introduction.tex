\section{Introduction}

Autonomous robots are making their way from the production industry to the service industry. This change introduces a new set of problems, that deal with interactions of people and robots. Some of these problems can be simplified by first detecting persons, which then allows for example, to follow people, approach or evade them while navigating through an environment.

All of these problems can be solved with model-based solutions, but since neural networks are becoming more and more viable, we introduce a new approach, that does not require knowledge about people or their movements. Instead, the network will find characteristics on its own and place unique identifiers on persons, which can then be passed onto further problems.
