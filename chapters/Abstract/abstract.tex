This study present a new approach to detecting humans in service environments. Making use of the latest advances in machine learning, fast scalable applications can be modeled without having knowledge about the inner workings. We present a leg detection tool, that operates on laser scan data, classifying each point as human or non-human. The results are further used to learn to identify people, allowing for precise operation of an autonomous robot in the service industry. This also includes prediction of trajectories, which will be used for movement of in crowded scenes.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.

% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
