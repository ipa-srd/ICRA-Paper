\section{Conclusion}

We presented a leg and person detector, working solely on Lidar input data. Laser points are labeled with high accuracy in close range to the robot. Detecting people using the trained model is a first in neural network and we find a high precision and an overall good model. We were able to outperform the state of the art, while simultaneously needing no knowledge about people viewed from a laser sensor, their shapes and movements. From the positions of people, we are finally able to predict their trajectories, which we can use in various environments.
