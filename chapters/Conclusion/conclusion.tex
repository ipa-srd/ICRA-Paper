\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\label{sec:Conclusion}

We presented a leg and person detector, working solely on lidar input data. A convolusional neural network was developed to label each input point as either leg or non-leg. We were then able to use information from the trained convolutions in order to cluster legs together as one person. The data is labeled with high accuracy in close range to the robot. Detecting people using the trained model is a first in neural network and we find a high precision and an overall good model. We were able to outperform the state of the art, while simultaneously needing no knowledge about people viewed from lidar data, their shapes and movements. From the positions of people, we are finally able to predict their trajectories, which we can use in various environments. The true positive detection of the lidar classifier can be improved by including other sensors, such as cameras or RGB-D, which can be viewed as a correction and validation. The trajectory prediction can also be further enhanced to include the environment, which plays a big role in trajectory prediction.
