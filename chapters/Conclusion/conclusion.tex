\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a new learning based approach to detect humans, working solely on Lidar input data. todo: add simple description of the approach
Laser points are labeled with high accuracy in close range to the robot. Detecting people using the trained model is a first in neural network and we find a high precision and an overall good model. We were able to outperform the state of the art, while simultaneously needing no knowledge about people viewed from a laser sensor, their shapes and movements. From the positions of people, we are finally able to predict their trajectories, which we can use in various environments.
todo: add future work
