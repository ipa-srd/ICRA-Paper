\section{Experimental results}

In order to evaluate the leg detector, the robot was set up in a corridor, recording legs of people passing through over a course of three hours. Walls were separated from the corridor, giving a ground truth of the data. The leg detector receives the input from the laser scan and labels each point as leg or non-leg.
In the comparison to the ground truth, we find, that the detector works best in close range, while becoming weaker as the range increases. This is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:radius_detection}, where a short, 100 second long exposure was analyzed.

The decrease in the first half originates mainly from the difficulty of interpreting the laser data, as the points spread further out depending on the distance to the scanner. The second half additionally suggests too few data points as input to the convolutional network.
At a distance of $2.2 m$ we still find good results in a reasonable range around the robot, which we can use to evaluate a three hour long recording of the same corridor. We find the confusion matrix in Table \ref{tab:truth}, omitting false and true negatives as the sensor recorded only a specific wall in that range as negative data, making the input redundant.
